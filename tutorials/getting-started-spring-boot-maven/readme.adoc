The tutorial shows the integration of jQAssistant into a https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] application which is built using http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven].
// end::lead[]

NOTE: This tutorial has been written for jQAssistant 1.4.0

== Prerequisites

- Spring Boot project based on http://maven.apache.org[Maven] as created by https://start.spring.io/[] using the required dependencies (e.g. `Web`, `JPA` and `H2`).

== Overview

jQAssistant comes with a plugin for Spring based applications that provides rules for enforcing best practices, e.g.

- allowed dependencies between Controllers, Services and Repositories
- correct usage of transactional methods
- enforcing constructor injection instead of field injection.
- ...

Detected violations will be printed as warnings at the end of the build or might break it if required.

The steps in this tutorial illustrate:

- Integration of the <<MavenPlugin>>
- Working with the <<PreDefinedRules>>
- Definition of <<ProjectSpecificRules>>

[[MavenPlugin]]
== jQAssistant Maven Plugin

jQAssistant runs as part of the build process and therefore needs to be integrated as Maven plugin.
This is done by adding the following setup to the `build/plugins` section of the file `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
include::pom.xml[tag=plugin,indent=0]
----

The configuration above...

- activates the goals `scan` and `analyze` during a build
- defines the rule group `spring-boot:Strict` to be executed during analysis (alternatively `spring-boot:Default`, for `package:Default` see <<ProjectSpecificRules>>)
- sets severity thresholds for printing warnings and breaking the build to `MINOR` (concepts) and `MAJOR` (constraints)
- sets the default severity for concepts that cannot be applied to `INFO`

The Maven build can be triggered as usual on the command line:

----
mvn clean install
----

NOTE: The default severity of concepts is `MINOR` and therefore the default setup would print a warning for each concept that could not be applied (e.g. if there are @Configuration annotated beans present in the code).
For this reason the proposed configuration sets the default concept severity to `INFO`.

[[PreDefinedRules]]
== Pre-Defined Rules

The setup above activates the pre-defined group `spring-boot:Strict` that contains recommended constraints for
the structure and architecture of the project.

Executing the goal `effective-rules` on the command line using

----
mvn jqassistant:effective-rules
----

prints a summary of the activated rules including their descriptions:

----
[INFO] Groups [7]
[INFO]   "spring-boot:Default"
[INFO]   "spring-boot:Strict"
[INFO]   "spring-component:Default"
[INFO]   "spring-component:Strict"
[INFO]   "spring-injection:Default"
[INFO]   "spring-injection:Strict"
[INFO]   "spring-transaction:Default"
[INFO] Constraints [15]
[INFO]   "spring-boot:AllTypesInApplicationPackage" - All types of of a Spring Boot application must be located in the same package or a sub-package of
            the application class.

[INFO]   "spring-component:ControllerMustOnlyDependOnServicesRepositoriesOrComponents" - A Spring controller can only have dependencies to other Spring components that are services or
            repositories.
...
----

TIP: There is also a pre-defined group activating a smaller set of rules.
For using it just replace `spring-boot:Strict` with `spring-boot:Default` in the `pom.xml` (see above).
For a detailed description of available concepts and constraints refer to the http://buschmais.github.io/jqassistant/doc/1.4.0/index.html#_concepts_and_constraints_provided_by_the_spring_plugin[plugin documentation].

[[ProjectSpecificRules]]
== Project Specific Rules

The concepts defined by the Spring plugin are also a good base for project specific rules.
Such rules must be located in the directory `/jqassistant` and can be written either in XML or Asciidoc files.

The latter is recommended and used in the following example. It defines:

- a group `package:Default` including the constraint `package:ServicePackageÂ´
- the constraint `package:ServicePackage` that ensures that Spring services (i.e. classes annotated with
`@Service`) are located in packages named `service`

.jqassistant/package.adoc
....
include::jqassistant/package.adoc[]
....

Finally the group `package:Default` must be activated, therefore the comment for this group in the file `pom.xml` (see above) must be removed.

The project can be built and verified by running the following command:

----
mvn clean install
----
